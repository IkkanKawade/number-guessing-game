# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This appears to be an empty or newly initialized repository with no source code, configuration files, or documentation present. The repository is tracked by Git but contains no committed files or project structure.

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, there are no specific build tools, dependencies, or development commands configured. Future development should begin by:

1. Initializing the project with appropriate tooling (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
2. Setting up the basic project structure
3. Adding necessary configuration files for the chosen technology stack

## Project Structure

Currently empty - no established architecture or file organization exists.

## Notes

This repository is ready for initial project setup and development. Once code is added, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to reflect the actual project structure, build commands, and architectural decisions.
